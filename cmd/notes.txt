Flags Used are:
    -n for number of lines (default = 10)
    -file for file name (default: reads from stdin)

For head:
    Tried using command line arguments but it didn't have option for multiLine stdin.
    THat's why i used bufio scanner for scanning stdin and saved in a string array, to paste them all at the end.
    Even tho files could paste directly without having to be saved prior in an array, i tried to make code cleaner by standardizing.

For tail:
    Same as head, except saving here was needed for files as well.
    //NOTE HERE: stdin will have to terminate in ctrl D


I took a lot of time bec initially 
    - I made filename as a flag, which after reading documentation of linux commands isn't correct / doesn't implement the required cmd commands
    - Checked go examples in detail and updated the head and tail implementations
    - Not knowing that we can track number of flags also made me ulter code later
